"Paul,

I assume for experienced programmers this project would have been easy, but I was surprised that I could accomplish it step by step without stressing.  At the beginning I had no idea what to do.  I was a bit overwhelmed by the many requirements.  Then I took the hints dropped in the assignment and formed small steps.  I fashioned small pieces of code to test my ideas, then assembled the program. 

Oddly, the one liner created the most frustration.  That was because I utterly forgot about the -i flag.  I also [incorrectly] used the "." character class, which didn't work because it doesn't match on a newline character (which every file's content has).

Thanks Paul!
